# Indigenous for iOS

Firstly thanks to [@swentel](https://github.com/swentel) for maintaining the iOS version for the past couple of years.

Indigenous is now being maintained and developed by [@marksuth](https://github.com/marksuth).

I'm currently going through and getting up to speed with the status of both this, and the desktop versions of the app, and will update soon with my plans for bringing everything up to parity with the excellent Android version, which can be found here: [https://github.com/swentel/indigenous-android](https://github.com/swentel/indigenous-android)



The initial version was originally developed and released 2017-2019 by [Eddie Hinkle](https://EddieHinkle.com).
